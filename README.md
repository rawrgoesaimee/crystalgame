# crystalgame

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page which has hidden values towards them until they are clicked, which will then add up the player's score counter.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

When you retart the game again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the userâ€™s score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
